Creation of the park
A wide variety of groups came together to help establish
the park in 1899. Scientists, mountaineers, conservation
groups, local businesses, and large railroad companies
all saw some possible benefit from a national park around
Mount Rainier. They combined their often disparate
interests into a lobbying campaign starting in 1893. It
stressed the potential for tourism from the nearby cities
of Seattle and Tacoma, the unsuitability of land for other
commercial purposes like agriculture, grazing, or mining,
and a need to preserve the unique glacial landscape for
further study. After hesitant congressmen received
assurances that the park would not come as an added
expense to the government, the bill passed in 1899.
Mount Rainier became the nation’s fifth national park
and the first to be established after the Forest Reserve
Act of 1891 that created the U.S. Forest Service. This
resolved any questions as to whether the nascent national
park and national forest systems would be administered as
separate entities with different objectives.

Early Years
Development at the park grew at a torrid and often chaotic
pace. Visitation ballooned from 1,786 in 1906 to 34,814
nine years later and park administrators struggled to keep
up with the constant demand for more roads, lodging, and
other services. The advent of automobiles increased the
accessibility of the park but also created new challenges.
Mount Rainier was the first national park to allow cars
and by the time a road was built to Paradise Park in 1910,
one third of the ranger force was being used for traffic
control. Concurrent with the growth in tourist activity was
an increased commercial interest in the natural resources
of the park. During the first fifteen years of the park’s
existence and in the absence of established regulations,
mining, water development, and timber schemes sprang up but
met with limited success.

1916-1930
The creation of the National Park Service in 1916 brought
significant changes to Mount Rainier. A professional ranger
force began to take on a greater role in managing the park,
including starting interpretive programs in 1921. This early
period before the Great Depression was also key for the
development of park infrastructure. The Paradise Inn was
opened in 1917 and plans to develop Sunrise were crafted
throughout the 1920s. Road construction reached its peak
with all of the roads in the park being built or surveyed
by 1930. These changes stimulated a larger debate that
continues to this day over the degree certain areas should
be developed or left as primitive wilderness.
