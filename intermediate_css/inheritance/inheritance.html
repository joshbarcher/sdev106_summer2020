            <p>Journalism is the production and distribution of reports
                on recent events. The word journalism applies to the occupation,
                as well as citizen journalists using methods of gathering
                information and using literary techniques. Journalistic
                media include print, television, radio, Internet, and,
                in the past, newsreels.

            <p>Concepts of the appropriate role for journalism vary between
                countries. In some nations, the news media are controlled by
                government intervention and are not fully independent. In
                others, the news media are independent of the government but
                instead operate as private industry motivated by profit. In
                addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are
                run and funded, countries may have differing implementations
                of laws handling the freedom of speech and libel cases.

            <p>Journalistic conventions vary by country. In the United States,
                journalism is produced by media organizations or by individuals.
                Bloggers are often, but not always, journalists. The Federal
                Trade Commission requires that bloggers who write about
                products received as promotional gifts to disclose that they
                received the products for free. This is intended to eliminate
                conflicts of interest and protect consumers.</p>
