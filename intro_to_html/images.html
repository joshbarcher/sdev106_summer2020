                    Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs
                    in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a
                    paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
                    coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
                    defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit.”
