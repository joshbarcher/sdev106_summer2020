            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs
                in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a
                paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and
                coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
                defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit.”
