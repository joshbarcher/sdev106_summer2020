        <h1>Browser History</h1>
        <section>
            <p>1993 was a landmark year with the release of Mosaic,
                credited as "the world's first popular browser".
                Its innovative graphical interface made the World Wide
                Web system easy to use and thus more accessible to the
                average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet boom
                of the 1990s when the Web grew at a very rapid rate.
                Marc Andreessen, the leader of the Mosaic team,
                soon started his own company, Netscape, which released
                the Mosaic-influenced Netscape Navigator in 1994.
                Navigator quickly became the most popular browser.

                Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading
                to a browser war with Netscape. Microsoft was able to
                gain a dominant position for two reasons: it bundled
                Internet Explorer with its popular Microsoft Windows
                operating system and did so as freeware with no
                restrictions on usage. Eventually the market share
                of Internet Explorer peaked at over 95% in 2002.
