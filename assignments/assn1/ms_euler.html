            <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
            <img src="ms_euler.png" alt="A portrait of Euler">

            <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
                <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There,
                he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean
                Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics
                and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
                Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time,
                publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His
                influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

            <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into
                mathematical analysis. Euler's work,
                Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748),
                remained a standard textbook in the field for
                well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau,
                he wrote
                Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772),
                giving a clear non-technical outline of the main
                physical theories of the time.</p>

            <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without
            copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such
            as e and &pi;, were introduced
            in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783,
            leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and
            certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

            <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

            <p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:</p>

            <code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e<sup>xi</sup></code>

            <p>which demonstrates the relationship between algebra,
            complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this
            equation, it's easy to derive the identity:</p>

            <code>e<sup>&pi;i+1</sup>=0</code>

            <p>which relates the fundamental constants:
            0, 1, &pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and
            elegant statement. A poll of readers
            conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
            magazine named Euler's Identity as the
            most beautiful theorem in the history of
            mathematics.</p>
